# LinuxAnimate
LinuxAnimate is like wrapper offline but it only works on linux and every linux distro including chromeos linux. Some features here are just about the same as wrapper offline. and this time, there are four channels on where you can get this lvm project from, they all include, the dev version (unstable) the beta version (not recomended) the goproduction version (lvm ment for goanimators) and the stable channel (for a first time goanimate user). Please have fun using LinuxAnimate on your linux machine!

## Limitations in the stable release.
You cannot create your own characters besides uploading and deleting them. i know that this may sound curel to some. but if you want that ability to create characters, you must get LinuxAnimate either from the goproduction channel or dev channel (dev channel is not recomended as it may be unstable)

## Limitations in other releases.
N/A
